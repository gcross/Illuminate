\section multiple_test_cases Multiple test cases

In all of the examples in the previous chapter we crammed all of our checks into a single test case.  However, it is possible to declare multiple test cases, such as in the following example:

\include_example{chapter2-multiple-test-cases-same-file}

Note that the test names are sorted;  this is done in order to make the test ordering and id numbers independent of the static initialization order of the platform.

Tests may also be spread out over multiple files:

\includelineno chapter2-multiple-test-cases-1.cpp
\includelineno chapter2-multiple-test-cases-2.cpp
\includelineno chapter2-multiple-test-cases-3.cpp
\verbinclude chapter2-multiple-test-cases-multiple-files.out

*/
// }}}
// Test suites {{{
/*! \page organizing_tests Organizing tests

\section test_suites Test suites

When you start to have a lot of tests, it makes sense to start organizing them into groups.  Illuminate allows you to do this with the TEST_SUITE macro, as illustrated in the following example:

\include_example{chapter2-test-suites}

The test cases in a particular suite may be spread over multiple files:

\includelineno chapter2-test-suite-multiple-files-1.cpp
\includelineno chapter2-test-suite-multiple-files-2.cpp
\verbinclude chapter2-test-suite-multiple-files.out

*/
// }}}
// Nesting {{{
/*! \page organizing_tests Organizing tests

\section nesting Nesting

Test suites and test cases can be arbitrarily nested, as illustrated in the following example:

\include_example{chapter2-nesting}

Note that the empty test suite A2a3 was not listed because it contained no tests.

\section skipping_and_forcing Skipping and forcing

Sometimes it is useful to temporarily disable a test case or a test suite without removing it entirely from the suite.  To do this, just add the prefix DONT_ before TEST_SUITE or TEST_CASE as in the following example:

\include_example{chapter2-dont-test}

If you want to re-enable selected test suites or test cases nested inside a skipped test suite, you may do so by adding the prefix MUST_ as in the following example:

\include_example{chapter2-must-test}
